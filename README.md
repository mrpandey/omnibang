# Omnibang

A very simple Chrome/Firefox extension that enables a user to search websites directly from the address bar.

It is based on [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) provided by DuckDuckGo and works in a similar way. The two main differences are:

- DuckDuckGo follows the format `!bang search-term`, whereas Omnibang follows `! bang search-term`.
- Omnibang works even if DuckDuckGo isn't your default search engine.

FAQ: Chrome and Firefox already provide custom search engines. What's different here?

- Browser custom search works when the website you want to search is already present in your history and cache.   
Bangs works independent of history and cache.

- The keywords of custom search by default are the complete domain names. You can manually shorten them.

DuckDuckGo provides 100s of predefined short-codes (bangs) which are easy to remember. 
Here are some of the bangs:

| Some | Popular | Bangs|
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub: `gh` | Stack Overflow: `so` | Stack Exchange: `se` |
| Mozilla Developer Network: `mdn` | MS Developer Network: `msdn` | Codepen: `cpen` |
| Reddit: `r` | Quora: `q` | Amazon: `a` |
| Wikipedia: `w` | Medium: `med` | Bing: `b` |
| Google: `g` | DuckDuckGo: `ddg` | Yahoo: `y` |
| Google Maps: `maps` | Facebook: `fb` | Twitter: `tw` |
| Spotify: `spt` | SoundCloud: `sc` | YouTube: `yt` |
