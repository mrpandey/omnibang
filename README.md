Note: This is no longer maintained. But feel free to use it if it works in your browser. I don't maintain it anymore because Vivaldi is now my main browser, where I can have a search bar next to the URL. URL bar has Google as the default search, and the search bar has DDG as the default. So I can now easily access the bangs without using this extension.

# Omnibang

A very simple Chrome/Firefox extension that enables a user to search websites directly from the address bar.

It is based on [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) provided by DuckDuckGo and works in a similar way. The two main differences are:

- DuckDuckGo follows the format `!bang search-term`, whereas Omnibang follows `! bang search-term`.
- Omnibang works even if DuckDuckGo isn't your default search engine.

FAQ: Chrome and Firefox already provide custom search engines. What's different here?

- Browser custom search works when the website you want to search is already present in your history and cache.   
Bangs works independent of history and cache.

- The keywords of custom search by default are the complete domain names. You can shorten them, but its manual work.

  DuckDuckGo provides 100s of predefined short-codes (bangs) which are easy to remember. Some bangs are listed at the bottom of this page.
